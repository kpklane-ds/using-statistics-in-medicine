The possible events in a coin flip are two.  The possible events in a card draw? 52.\n","\n","Probability, on the other hand, is the likelihood that a possible event occurs, given a random opportunity.  The probability of pulling a Jack from a deck is 4/52, or 0.0769; the probability of a coin landing on heads? 1/2 or 0.5.\n","\n","#### The bounds of probability\n","\n","The probability of an event occurring is always a fraction, or a number between 0 and 1.  When probability is 0, there is no chance a thing will happen.  When it is 1, it is certain to happen.  If there are 4 marbles in a bag, and all of them are blue, then the probability of a blue marble being drawn is 4/4, or 1 - a certainty.  \n","\n","#### Additive probability\n","\n","The probability of one **or** another event occurring is the **sum** of the individual probabilities, if the events are mutually exclusive and cannot co-occur.\n","\n","What if they **can** co-occur?  Then, to get P(one or the other) one must sum P(one) and P(other), then **subtract** P(one & the other).\n","\n","#### Multiplicative probability\n","\n","The probability of two events **both** occurring is the **product** of the individual probabilities, if the events are independent.\n","\n","#### Conditional probability - Bayes Rule\n","\n","If two events are NOT independent, what we have is **conditional probability**.  Bayes Rule, dealing with conditional probability, states that if we know the independent rates of occurrence of two events, we can find the probability of one event given that the other has occurred.\n","\n","*Probability of Disease Given Symptom = Probability of Disease * Probability of Symptom, Given Disease / Probability of Symptom*\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"PL31DSaPC-KD","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710463245644,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":146,"user":{"displayName":"Kyle Rasku","userId":"06957673124617695133"}},"outputId":"f66cf177-f558-4938-f26d-b7f9cca76aaa"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["0.4"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":1}],"source":["# Additive Probability\n","\n","# Liver Disease Example, page 52\n","total_patients = 20\n","prob_hepB = 4/20\n","prob_cirrhosis = 6/20\n","prob_both = 2/20\n","\n","# If a patient is selected at random, what is the probability of Hepatitis B OR Cirrhosis being the diagnosis?\n","prob_hepB + prob_cirrhosis -
